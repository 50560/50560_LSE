Attatched on this repository is all scripts that were used in the final output of this dissertation. This includes all analysis and plotting scripts for all models, moderatures and features.
A brief overview of the function of each script is as follows:
Forrest Plotting Script: produced  appendix figures from B.1-B.5.
Main Analysis Scipt: used for hypothesis 1, running an OLS for all content IDs by treatent and control specification, merging these in a block diagnonal matrix and then estimating coefficients by ad content type.
Main Analysis Scipt by race and Main Analysis Scipt by eductaion: opperated similarly to the main script but instead sub-sected the data by racial divisions and eductaion levels specified in the models before recombining and adding in moderators.
Plotting Raw Coefficients: was used to create comparison figures 1,2 and 3.
