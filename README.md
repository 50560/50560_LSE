Attatched on this repository is the key scripts that were used in the final output of this dissertation. This includes all analysis and plotting scripts for all models, moderatures and features.
A brief overview of the function of each script is as follows:
Forrest Plotting Script: produced  appendix figures from B.1-B.4.
Main Analysis Scipt: used for hypothesis 1, running an OLS for all content IDs by treatment and control specification, merging these in a block diagnonal matrix and then estimating coefficients by ad content type.
Main Analysis Scipt by race and Main Analysis Scipt by eductaion: opperated similarly to the main script but instead sub-sected the data by racial divisions and eductaion levels specified in the models before recombining and interacting moderators.
Plotting Raw Coefficients: was used to create comparison figures 1,2 and 3.
